## Overview

Interested in building small robotics + electronics projects? This list is a "starter pack" of electronics supplies + tools that I've found useful in a small home maker's workbench.

This list might be useful for:
- Small electronics projects
- Small robots
- RC aircraft and vehicles
- IoT projects
- 3D Prints and Mixed-media art

This list doesn't cover:
- Large projects you can't do inside an apartment/house (Welding, woodwork, etc)
- Precision surface-mount PCBs
